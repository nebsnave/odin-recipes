    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This is a swampy swampy soup. Quite swampy indeed.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1/2 lb carrots</li>
        <li>3 ribs celery</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dried basil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>3 8 oz. cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 15 oz. cans diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1.5 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 10 oz. package drozen chopped spinach</li>
        <li>8 oz. Swiss cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mince the garlic, dice the onion, peel and slice the carrots, and slice the celery. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery to a large soup pot with the olive oil and saut√© over medium heat for about five minutes, or until the onions are soft.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes (with juices), vegetable broth, basil, and oregano to the pot. Stir to combine, then allow the soup to come to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Once the soup is simmering, add the frozen spinach (no need to thaw). Stir the spinach into the hot soup until it has melted and heated through.</li>
        <li>Once the spinach is thoroughly mixed into the soup, give the soup a taste and add salt if needed. I did not add any, but this will ultimately depend on the sodium content of your canned goods and vegetable broth.</li>
        <li>Dice the swiss cheese into small cubes. Add a small handful of cubes to each bowl, then ladle the hot soup over top. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
