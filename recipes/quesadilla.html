    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 15 oz. can black beans</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 bunch fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 packet of taco seasoning</li>
        <li>10 flour tortillas</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the black beans and add them to a bowl along with the frozen corn (no need to thaw)</li>
        <li>Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and roughly chop the cilantro. </li>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, shredded cheddar, and taco seasoning to the bowl with the beans and corn.
             Stir until everything is evenly combined and coated in seasoning.</li>
        <li>Place a half cup of the filling on one side of each tortilla and fold over.
            Cook the quesadillas in a skillet over medium heat on each side until brown and crispy and the cheesy filling has melted. 
            Slice into triangles then serve.</li>
        <li>To freeze the quesadillas, stack the filled and uncooked quesadillas with a piece of parchment paper between each quesadilla. Place in a freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. 
            To reheat either microwave (for a soft quesadilla) or cook in a skillet on low heat (make sure to use low heat so that the filling has time to thaw and melt before the outside burns).</li>
    </ol>
